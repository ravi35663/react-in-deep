        <DOM Updated - In a single batch (Because DOM is very expensive task for browser)>
        #Here , it optimized the application
        - child 1 componentDidMount is called
        - child 2 componentDidMount is called
    - Parent componentDidMount is called

    this is the behavior of react to optimize performance of the application
